### Hello 👋

I'm Lyndsey, a Front End Developer from Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿.

I like learning new things and I facilitate that through building, because I think that's the best way to learn.

I advocate for clean code and encourage practices like TDD wherever possible. Take care of the code so that it can take care of itself later.

📦 OS contributions: I created a [prefix tree](https://github.com/lyndseybrowning/trie-prefix-tree) implementation using JavaScript. I needed a way to store dictionaries of over 130,000 words for my online game [word-scrambler](http://word-scrambler.co.uk/) and found the prefix tree to be a perfect solution for fast retrieval of information. 

⚡ Fun fact: I'm a big fan of [Boggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle), having played online for 15+ years. You can [watch me play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjC3Vbgva8k) on my YouTube channel. I built my own [solver](https://github.com/lyndseybrowning/node-boggle-solver) because I wanted to understand the algorithm, and I created a [UI](http://lyndseyb.co.uk/boggle-solver/) for it so I could visualise boards being solved in real time.
